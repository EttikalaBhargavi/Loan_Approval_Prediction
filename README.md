Objective:
The Loan Approval Prediction project aims  to develop a robust machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on a range of financial and demographic features. 
Banks are making major part of profits through loans. Though lot of people are applying for loans. 
Itâ€™s hard to select the genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually, lot of misconception may happen to select the genuine applicant. Therefore we are developing loan prediction system using machine learning, so the system automatically selects the eligible candidates. This is helpful to both bank staff and applicant.
